# About Brain-Games
Brain-Games - is the frist educational project from Hexlet courses. It's simple as much as could be the simplest shell game.
There are six games in the pack: 
1. Guess the even number
2. Guess the prime number
3. Find a GCD of two numbers
4. Find a missing number from progression
5. Calc game (add, multiply and subtract)
6. Balance a couple of numbers (my favourite)

# INSTALL 
Make sure that you are using some of Unix systems.

To run the game from the shell you should have installed node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/ 

Enter the following command into the command line: npm install dzhumandzhu -g

-g (global option) allows you to run this game from any folder
